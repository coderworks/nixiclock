Watch out for frying the tubes or drivers...

Diving into this project you'll find NMEA messages from the GPS system converted to chars in ASCII to BCD. All this is done with a U-blox GPS device for a drone connected to an Arduino which drives an old 4 Nixi tubes pcb. Well it fried after all... But the code still worked perfectly.
